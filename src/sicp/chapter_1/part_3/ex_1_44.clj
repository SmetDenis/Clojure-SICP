; Exercise 1.44
; The idea of smoothing a function is an important concept in signal processing.
; If f is a function and dx is some small number, then the smoothed version of f is the function
; whose value at a point x is the average of f(xâˆ’dx), f(x), and f(x+dx).
;
; Write a procedure smooth that takes as input a procedure that computes f and returns
; a procedure that computes the smoothed f.
;
; It is sometimes valuable to repeatedly smooth a function
; (that is, smooth the smoothed function, and so on) to obtain the n-fold smoothed function.
;
; Show how to generate the n-fold smoothed function of any given function
; using smooth and repeated from Exercise 1.43.
