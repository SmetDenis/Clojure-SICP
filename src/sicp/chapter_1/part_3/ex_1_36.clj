; Exercise 1.36
; Modify fixed-point so that it prints the sequence of approximations it generates,
; using the newline and display primitives shown in Exercise 1.22.
; Then find a solution to x^x=1000 by finding a fixed point of x->log(1000)/log(x).
;
; (Use Schemeâ€™s primitive log procedure, which computes natural logarithms.)
; Compare the number of steps this takes with and without average damping.
; (Note that you cannot start fixed-point with a guess of 1, as this would cause division by log(1)=0)
