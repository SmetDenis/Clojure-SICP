; Exercise 1.10
; The following procedure computes a mathematical function called Ackermannâ€™s function.
(defn A
  [x y]
  (cond (zero? y) 0
        (zero? x) (* 2 y)
        (= y 1) 2
        :else (A (dec x)
                 (A x (dec y)))))

; What are the values of the following expressions?
(A 1 10)
(A 2 4)
(A 3 3)

; Consider the following procedures, where A is the procedure defined above:
(defn f
  [n]
  (A 0 n))

(defn g
  [n]
  (A 1 n))

(defn h
  [n]
  (A 2 n))

(defn k
  [n]
  (* 5 n n))

; Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computed
; by the procedures f, g, and h for positive integer values of n.
; For example, (k n) computes 5*n^2.
