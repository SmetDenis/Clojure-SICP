; Exercise 1.24
; Modify the timed-prime-test procedure of Exercise 1.22 to use fast-prime? (the Fermat method),
; and test each of the 12 primes you found in that exercise.
;
; Since the Fermat test has Î˜(logn) growth, how would you expect the time to test primes near 1,000,000
; to compare with the time needed to test primes near 1000? Do your data bear this out?
;
; Can you explain any discrepancy you find?
