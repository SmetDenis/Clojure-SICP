; Exercise 2.51
;
; Define the below operation for painters. Below takes two painters as arguments.
; The resulting painter, given a frame, draws with the first painter in the bottom of
; the frame and with the second painter in the top. Define below in two different waysâ€”first by
; writing a procedure that is analogous to the beside procedure given above, and again in terms
; of beside and suitable rotation operations (from Exercise 2.50).
